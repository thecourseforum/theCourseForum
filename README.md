theCourseForum
==============
### Connecting University of Virginia Students to Course information and Reviews


### About
theCourseForum was created by students for students. We gather freeley available information to help students evaluate their course options at the University. Students in turn then review courses in their own words for others to help others.

Started 5 years ago, the project has grown monuementally. A very large percentage of the student body uses the website each and every semester. We gather statists and other information in an effort to help students select classes better. The public code apart of this statement is the second major version of the website.

The Organization itself is a group of students that contribute their time and effort to contiue to improve the site for other students to use.

### Stack
The code stack is current standard technologies. They were chosen specifically because they are standard, modern and incredibly ubiquitous technologies.

- Ruby 2.2.3
- Rails 4.2.4
- MySQL
- Bootstrap 3
- Javascript (jQuery)

### Deployment
The rails app can be deployed in any fashion, there is no special deployment requirements. Our server deployment uses Phusion Passenger AKA mod_rails on top of the Apache Webserver. For development, we switch between Passenger testing and the thin development server. Internally, everything is vanilla including MySQL, Javascript, and Bootstrap 3.
